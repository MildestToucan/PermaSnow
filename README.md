PermaSnow
======
## Because building in snowy biomes shouldn't require melting it all.

### What does this mod do?
PermaSnow is a very simple mod that allows players to simply disable snow melting from light sources. It also allows you 
to configure the light level at which snow melts, if you decide to enable snow melting anyway.

### How do I use this mod?
Snow melting is disabled by the mod's default configuration, so if that's all you want, you just install the mod, and that's it.  
It is server-sided and just works with no additional setup.

However, PermaSnow also allows you to toggle its effects via config. It is recommended to use the [McQoy](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcqoy) 
config if you want the ability to visually edit the config when the mod is installed on the client.  
Otherwise PermaSnow's config file is created under the `config` folder in your MC files. That folder should be found in the same 
folder as your `saves` folder on the client for instance.

The config's values are updated internally on restart or on McQoy config change, and are not world-specific.  
The config is not world-specific because it is assumed that one player/server generally has the same preferences for snow melting 
regardless of the world they play on. McQoy makes it particularly easy to edit on the client if needed.

If your config appears broken, you can delete the file and it'll be rebuilt on the game's next startup.
